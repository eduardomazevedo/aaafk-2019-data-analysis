======================================================================


The replication archive has three parts.

make-data            : Formats the raw input data from the APD, NKR ad UNOS.

descriptive-analysis : Replication code for descriptive tables and figures

production-function-analysis : Replication code for simulating the
		       production function and subsequent analysis and
		       output

Each of these parts are in their own folders. These folders each
contain readme files that explain the computing infrastructure,
required files and process for replication. The "make-data" repository
code must be executed first. The other two repositories can be run
once make-data has been completed as output from make-data is used in
the other two repositories.
